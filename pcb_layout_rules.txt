"Pref" means preferred minimum value. Do not go below this value unless there is a unique reason to do so. Use the largest value possible for each design, since larger/thicker is more reliable/legible.

"PCBCart Min" is the minimum value our board house will allow. Often there is a surcharge for this. It should be avoided unless there’s no reasonable way around it.



Trace thickness: 
PCBCart Min: 0.004
Pref: 0.005
Typical: 0.008 

Clearance/spacing:
PCBCart Min: 0.004
Pref (if necessary): 0.005
Pref: 0.010
Sensitive/Power: 0.015 

Via holes:
PCBCart Min: 0.004
Pref (if necessary): 0.008
Pref (cheaper): 0.016 

Via diameter:
PCBCart Min: 0.012 with 0.004 hole
Pref: 0.020 with 0.008 hole, or 0.032 with 0.016 hole

Silk legends: (Height/Width/Thickness)
PCBCart Min: ???
Pref: 0.040/0.040/0.006 = 1mm/1mm/.15mm
Min legible: 0.024/0.024/0.006 = 0.6mm/0.6mm/.15mm
Bigger and thicker is easier to read, if there’s room.

Distance from Edge Cut to pad or trace:
Pref: 10mil


Height and Width of PCB:
Height ideal: 4.3" (109.22mm)
Heigh max (if necessary): 4.365" (110.871mm)
Width ideal < width of faceplate (EnsOsc = 2.9mm shorter than faceplate)
Width max = width of faceplate
