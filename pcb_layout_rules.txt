"Pref" means preferred minimum value. Do not go below this value unless there is a unique reason to do so. Use the largest value possible for each design, since larger/thicker is more reliable/legible.

"Fab Min" is the minimum value our board house will allow. 

Trace thickness: 
Fab Min: 2-layer: 5mil (0.127mm). 4-layer: 3.5mil (0.09mm)
Pref: 6mil minimum (.15mm)
Typical: 8mil if possible (.2mm)

Clearance/spacing:
Fab Min: 2-layer: 5mil (0.127mm). 4-layer: 3.5mil (0.09mm)
Pref (if necessary): 6mil minimum (.15mm)
Pref: 8mil if possible (0.2mm)
Sensitive/Power: 12mil if possible (0.3mm)

Vias:
Fab Min:15.7mil diameter/7.87mil hole (0.4mm diameter/0.2mm hole)
Pref: 20mil diameter/8mil hole minimum, or 32mil diameter/16mil hole if possible

Silk legends: (Height/Width/Thickness)
Fab Min: 40mil(1mm) min height. 6mil (0.15mm) min line thickness
Pref: 0.040/0.040/0.006 = 1mm/1mm/.15mm
Min legible: 0.024/0.024/0.006 = 0.6mm/0.6mm/.15mm
Bigger and thicker is easier to read, if thereâ€™s room.

Distance from Edge Cut to pad or trace:
Pref: 10mil

Distance between jack and LED w/light pipe (Center to Center):
345mil (8.76mm)

Height and Width of PCB:
Height ideal: 4.3" (109.22mm)
Heigh max (if necessary): 4.365" (110.871mm)
Width ideal < width of faceplate (EnsOsc = 2.9mm shorter than faceplate)
Width max = width of faceplate
Minimum distance from edge of PCB to edge of faceplate: 0.347" (8.81mm)
