**Preparing the File**

1. Make visible only the "mount" and "maximum pcb size" layers

2. Select all desired objects and copy them.

3. Paste the objects and drag them to a new place on the screen

4. With all desired objects still highlighted, go to "Object" in the Menu and select "Ungroup". Do this a total of three times.

5. Change fill to empty and change stroke to black - you can find this under "Window" in the menu and select "Color". Note that some objects may remain gray. This hasn't caused a problem yet.

6. Make sure they're still all selected the whole time. Go to "File >> Export >> Export as..."

7. Name the file and change the file type to "Autodesk RealDWG (dxf)" and click "Export"

8. Follow the instructions and screenshot below to finish generating DFX file.
